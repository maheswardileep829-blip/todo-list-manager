# TODO List Manager

A command-line TODO list application with file persistence built in Python.

## Features

- ✅ Add tasks
- ✅ View all tasks with completion status
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ Save tasks to file (automatic)
- ✅ Load tasks on startup

## How It Works

Tasks are stored as JSON in `todos.txt` and automatically loaded when the program starts. Each task has a name and completion status (○ incomplete, ✓ complete).

## Usage
```bash
python todo_list.py
```

Choose from the menu:
1. View all tasks
2. Add a task
3. Mark task as complete
4. Delete a task
5. Save and quit
